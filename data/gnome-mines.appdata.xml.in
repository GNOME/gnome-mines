   GNOME Mines is a puzzle game where you search for hidden mines. Flag the
   spaces with mines as quickly as possible to make the board a safer place. You
   win the game when you've flagged every mine on the board. Be careful not to
   trigger one, or the game is over!

   You can select the size of the field you want to play on at the start of the
   game. If you get stuck, you can ask for a hint: there's a time penalty, but
   that's better than hitting a mine!
