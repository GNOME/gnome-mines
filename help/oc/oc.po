"Now we're going to try a complicated example. It illustrates two points. The "
"first is that even if you aren't sure which squares are mined, restricting "
"the possibilities is helpful. The second is that knowing which squares "
"aren't mined is nearly as good as knowing which are mined."

"Assume that, in the figure below, we start off knowing that the top left "
"square is mined and so the two squares marked 2 on the left only require one "
"more mine. Next observe that the left-most 2 implies that one of the covered "
"squares beneath it is mined, but we don't yet know which one. Since at least "
"one of these squares is mined and they are both neighbors of the second 2 "
"then we know that that 2 is also satisfied by one of these two squares (we "
"still don't know which one). This means that the square beneath the 4 is "
"clear because it is also a neighbor of the second 2 and not one of the two "
"squares we identified previously. This one blank square now leaves the 4 "
"with only four neighbors - all of which must be mines. Not only does it tell "
"us which mines surround the 4, it now tells us which of the squares beside "
"the 2 is mined!"

"This sort of situation is tricky. In all the other examples you can learn to "
"look for patterns and avoid thinking hard. Situations like the one in the "
"figure don't crop up easily or in easily recognisable places. Often it is "
"easier to just ignore them and keep playing elsewhere in the hope that you "
"can start clearing the squares from the other side."

"Sometimes you end up in a situation where there is no way to deduce what the "
"configuration is. In these cases you either have to guess or use the hint "
"function (<menuchoice><guimenu>Game</guimenu><guimenuitem>Hint</"

"One final hint: remember the counter on the bottom left of the window that "
"tells you how many mines you have left? Often, near the end of the game, "
"this number can help you figure out what possible places mines can be. How "
"to do this is up to you to figure out."
